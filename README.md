Thank you for your interest in contributing to NetworthDB.
Your contributions are welcome.

Since the project is under PolyForm Noncommercial License,
I have added Contributor License Agreement (CLA) for both individuals and entities.

Please read the contributor license agreement [for individuals](docs/licenses/CLA_INDIVIDUAL.md) and/or [for entities](docs/licenses/CLA_ENTITY.md) before submitting your contributions. If you make any contributions, it is assumed that you have read and agree to the terms of the CLA.

#### Background on License Choice

I'm undecided about pursuing any commercial opportunities with this project.
If in the future I do, I'll be more than happy to sign agreements, provide credits and share profits (even retroactively) but I don't want to legally bind myself to any commitments.

Moreover, I plan to teach programming to some students and pay them for their work, but I don't want to misguide them into thinking that they'll benefit from any future commercial opportunities beyond our initially agreed terms.

If you have any questions or want to sign a different CLA while I get my ducks in a row, please [contact me](mailto:ajay39in+networthdb@gmail.com).
